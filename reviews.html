				<li class="list-group-item">The Sorrows of Young Werther</li>
				<li class="list-group-item">Regarding the characters: 
I do not feel pity for Werther, The Editor. 
Werther is egocentric and shows little personal development. His mind is fragile, clutching to an idealised view of his superiority. He blossoms when he is loved at Wahlheim, the townsfolk are romanticised, but only because Werther can compare the daily doings to great labours of our ancestors. He is carefree, living off income from his Mother, who, I can only assume, has become annoyed by his superior intelligence. Upon entering Weimar, Werther is confronted with classist society. He is no longer superior, however much he criticises. In Werther's defence, this does lead to some thinkings regarding his privileges, but this does not last. How can Werther not be loved? So, he returns to Wahlheim.
His idealisation of the people in Wahlheim narrows purely onto Lotte, a young girl who takes care of her siblings after the death of their mother. Werther idealises her, for she is pure and uncorrupted, she is Werther's mother, Jesus' mother, everyone's mother. Lotte continues to be friends, but decides that Werther should not visit as often. Werther soon sexually idealises her, and Werther realises that he will never have Lotte. How can Werther not get what he wants? Two events during this time echo what will eventually happen: either Werther will confess his love, she will dismiss, and he will become insane, or he will confess his love, she will dismiss, and he will try to rape her. Wahlheim, according to Werther, operates according to an ancient patriarchal code, untainted by the influence of erudition, does it not?
And so, Werther realises that the only solution is for him to take it own life.
Regarding the writing, and the novel:
The language is beautiful. The words are lofty, sublime throughout. The storms echo Werther's emotions. It is Sturm und Drang. There is no rationalism in this book. Emotions and experiences dictate. As Werther begins to deteriorate mentally, the style of writing alters from one of verbosity and grandeur to bluntness and factual. As emotion leave Werther, rationalism begins to set in: with Lotte denying his love, obscurity no longer exists. His world has become binary. And for Werther, the response is FALSE.
